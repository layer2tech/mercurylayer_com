# Introduction

Mercury Layer is an implementation of a layer-2 MPC protocol that enables off-chain transfer and settlement of Bitcoin outputs that remain under the full custody of the owner at all times, while benefiting from instant and neglible cost transactions. The ability to perform this transfer without requiring the confirmation (mining) of on-chain transactions has advantages in a variety of different applications.
